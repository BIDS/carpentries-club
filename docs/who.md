Who We Are and What We Can Teach
===============

To add yourself, start a Pull Request on this page on our GitHub repo, and join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/lists.berkeley.edu/forum/#!forum/carpentries-club).
To request a workshop, email us at bids-workshops@berkeley.edu and we'll see if someone is available. We may not be able to help everyone but we hope we'll be a good place to start.
